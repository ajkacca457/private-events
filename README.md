# private Events

> This is a Microverse Ruby on rails project that allows users to create events, attend events, cancel event attendance and see who is attending an event. It also has a login and sign up functionality. Users are normally
restricted from using the app until they sign up and log in.

## Features
In this project I developed a simple event app with authentication:

- The form uses Bootstrap library for css combined with embedded ruby code
- The back end is set up with User,Event and Attendance models that validates presence of username,password,event title,event description. These models also contains different associations between each other.
- I manually created different controller and session functions to perform user's authentication and corresponding actions such as Log in, Log out,Sign up.
- If user check the page without being authenticated, he/she will not be able to see the events and the timestamps from the events. Once user do the login then he/she can use all the functionalities of the app.
- Any user who signed up and logged in can create their own events.
- Any user who signed up and logged in can create attend displayed upcoming events.
- Event show page displays event description with it's title, date and names of the people attending the event.
- User can see his or her own profile and can check events history (number of events user created or number of events user attended or going to attend)
- Pagination is used for visual appeal.
